## These two functions are here to test assgning objects 
## in a different environment.

## First one constructsts a matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## This one calculates the inverse or takes it from cache
## (if available)

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
